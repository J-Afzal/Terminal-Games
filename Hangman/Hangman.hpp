//  Hangman game where no hyphens or spaces allowed in the
//  word to be guessed. The programs first asks the user for a word, then
//  for the number of players, with one meaning an AI user will guess the word
//  and 2 meaning a human user will guess the word. The user guessing the
//  word is prompted for a guess and can handle a word or a letter guess. Note
//  a word guess will not replace any letters but just compare the guess with
//  the word to be guessed and the AI is dumb and randomly chooses a letter.
//  With each incorrect guess the hangman is drawn more until it is complete
//  (after 10 incorrect guesses) or the word has been guessed.
