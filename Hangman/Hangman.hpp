//
//  The classic Hangman game where no hyphens or spaces are allowed in
//  the word to be guessed. Also guessing a word will not replace any letters
//  but just compare it with the word to be guessed. With each incorrect guess the
//  hangman is drawn more until it is complete (after 10 incorrect guesses) or when the
//  word has been guessed.
//
//  Important Points
//      - 2 users represents two human players, with one creating the word and the other guessing the word
//      - 1 user represents one human player and one computer player, the human player is then asked who
//        is guessing the word, and so all combinations of human and computer variants are possible
//      - 0 users represents zero human players and two computer players
//      - The AI is dumb and both randomly picks a word from Words.txt and a random letter when guessing
//      - The The game is played through the function `Play_Hangman()`
//
