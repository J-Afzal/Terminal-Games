//  The classic TicTacToe game with options to pick the number
//  of users and which player the human user would like to be (X or O)
//
//  Important Points
//  - 2 users represents two human players and thus no need to ask user which player they would like to be
//  - 1 user represents a human player vs the computer and so the human player is asked which player they would like to be (X or O)
//  - 0 users represents no human players and thus computer vs computer
//  - The AI is 'dumb' as it picks random positions
//  - The The game is played through the function `Play_TicTacToe()`
